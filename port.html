      <h3>An intro to my work</h3>
      <p>After getting in to Girls Who Code, I've programmed many projects using Python. My first Python project was to draw shapes using the Turtle. After tackling that, I created an object, a bouncing ball, that randomly bounced off the walls. Afterwards, I mimicked the Obamicon picture by changing the pixel colors of a specific picture. In my second week of learning Python, I expanded on the bouncing ball. Now, there are unlimited number of balls that the user can create by clicking on the display screen. This was hard because I had to learn how to use user input. Then, I created a game, which was the hardest project I had done yet. In the runner game, the background was set to three "cityscapes" that would scroll to the left. The player would then move the mouse around, which directs a butterfly, which is the player's icon, around the screen, trying to eat the good sprites, demonstrated by flowers, and avoiding the bad sprites, as shown by the bombs. After colliding with three bombs, the player would have lost all three lives, and the game would end. This was challenging because I had to keep track of the total score, as well as how many lives were lost, but it was very satisfying to see the end result. </p>
