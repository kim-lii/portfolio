      <h3>What's the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance</h3>
      <p>In my sophomore year, I took an AP Computer Science class at Gunn. This class was very challenging for me because I had not taken the two intro classes that prepare you for the AP class. I learned some Java by myself during the summer so that I would not fall too behind the rest of my classmates, but I still struggled a lot. I did not do stellarly for the first few tests, but after studying very hard and completing many extra projects for more experience, I managed to raise my grade to an A. Later that year, I had to take the APCS test offered by CollegeBoard. When I first took a diagnostic test, I was at the level of getting a 3 or 4, and I was pretty far from getting a full score of 5. I completed the textbook with all of the practice tests offered in it, but I stil did not feel confident, so I decided to look for more practice. I went online and completed at least fifteen or twenty tests, and when the test day finally came, I felt very comfortable and confident, and I ended up getting the 5 I wanted.</p>
      <p>I think that the fact that the class was so challenging to me drove me to enjoy it. The problems were so hard for me to figure out, and most times, I couldn't even think of the solution, never mind coding it. However, once I did figure it out, I felt so proud of myself.</p>
